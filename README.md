# Rick Roll Trap â€“ ESP32 WiFi/LTE AP Project

**Rick Roll Trap** is a fun project built around the **ESP32** microcontroller that connects to an LTE or WiFi network and then creates its own password-free WiFi network. Once a user connects to this network, the device instantly "rick rolls" them by redirecting to the iconic Rick Astley's *Never Gonna Give You Up* music video. A creative use of the ESP32 and WiFi/LTE networks to create a playful network prank.

## Features:
- **LTE/WiFi Connection**: The ESP32 connects to an existing WiFi or LTE network.
- **Creates WiFi Access Point**: The microcontroller sets up its own password-free WiFi network.
- **Rick Rolling**: After a user connects to the network, the ESP32 automatically redirects them to the *Never Gonna Give You Up* music video on YouTube.

## Use Cases:
- **Education**: A fun way to learn about working with ESP32 and networking (WiFi/LTE).
- **Pranks**: Use this project to prank friends or colleagues with a hilarious Rick Roll.
